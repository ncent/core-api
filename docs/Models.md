#Challenge Models

## Challenge Models Relationship Diagram

![alt text](./UML/ChallengeModels.png)

## Challenge

The Challenge model encapsulates all of the relevant data associated with a specific tree of transactions. More specifically, the “root node” is a sponsor who decides all of the parameters up front (see the properties below), which will determine the size and shape of the ensuing tree as transactions are made.

#### Properties

1. parentChallenge
   * A challenge might semantically be something along the lines of “build a car”. A child task of this broad goal could be something like “design the braking system”. All of these goals can be represented in this scheme as a “challenge”, and in this case, the “build a car” challenge would serve as the parent challenge. This property points to a parent challenge, if there is one.
   * Reference pointing to Challenges table
   * Optional field
1. challengeSettings
   * Reference pointing to ChallengeSettings table
   * Required field 
1. subChallenges
   * this is the representation of the children of a given challenge. See the description on the parentChallenge property above.
   * Relationship through ChallengeToSubChallenges join table
1. completionCriterias
   * Reference pointing to CompletionCriteria table
   * Required field
1. cryptoKeyPair
   * Reference pointing to CryptoKeyPair table

   * Optional field

## CompletionCriteria

# Token Models

## Token Models Relationship Diagram

![alt text](./UML/TokenModels.png)

# Transaction Models

## Transaction Models Relationship Diagram

![alt text](./UML/Transactions.png)

## Transaction

A model representing any “event” - or a change in data that occurs on-chain. Examples of a transaction could be the creation of a challenge, the expiration of a challenge, or simply the transfer of tokens from one key pair to another

#### Properties

1. from
   * The public key from which the transaction occurs
   * varchar (length: 256)
   * Required field
1. to
   * The public key to which the transaction ends, if there is one. a challenge expiration, for example, would not need this data field
   * varchar (length: 256)
   * Optional field (in the case of a pure state change for a challenge)
1. action
   * Reference to Action table
   * Required field 
1. previousTransaction
   * A link to the transaction that occurred before this one (to track the tree)
   * Reference to Transaction table
   * Optional
1. metadatas
   * Reference to Metadata table through TransactionsMetadata join table

## Action

The Action model stores the semantic metadata for a Transaction instance. Given that a transaction can represent much more than the sharing of tokens from one wallet to another (i.e. challenge creation, expiration, etc.), it makes sense to store this data separately from the transaction entity itself.

#### Properties

1. type
   * an enum value providing a semantic representation of the type of transaction that is occurring 
   * enum 
   * required field
   * possible values
      * TRANSFER
      * CREATE
      * SHARE
      * PAYOUT
      * ACTIVATE
      * COMPLETE
      * INVALIDATE
      * EXPIRE
1. data
   * the ID of the entity that is the subject of the transaction that this action is associated with
   * integer
   * required field 
1. dataType
   * the type of data from the above property
   * varchar (length: 100)
   * required field

# Other Models

#### Properties

1. publicKey
   * varchar (length: 256)
   * Required field
1. encryptedPrivateKey
   * varchar (length: 256)

   * Required field
1. value
   * varchar (length: 256)
